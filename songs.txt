Last Christmas#Last Christmas, I gave you my heart#But the very next day you gave it away#This year, to save me from tears#I'll give it to someone special#Last Christmas, I gave you my heart#But the very next day you gave it away#This year, to save me from tears#I'll give it to someone special#Once bitten and twice shy#I keep my distance#But you still catch my eye#Tell me, baby#Do you recognize me?#Well, it's been a year#It doesn't surprise me#(Merry Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it#With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it#Now, I know what a fool I've been#But if you kissed me now#I know you'd fool me again#Last Christmas, I gave you my heart#But the very next day you gave it away#This year, to save me from tears#I'll give it to someone special#Last Christmas,…#

Where did your heart go?#I spend my nights down on the wharf#In unlit alleyways#By the church downtown#Where Sally prays#Come down sometime#We'll share a rusty can of corn#And listen to the radio#I love you, I love you, it says#Where did your heart go#Did you put it on a train#Did you leave it in the rain#Or down in Mexico#You cry, but I don't know#I've heard it all before#There it goes again, the slamming of the door#Sometimes the river calls me#And at night it calls my name#Says "put your troubles down beside me"#Things have always been the same#And rock 'n' roll won't teach me#What the river said that night#I jumped into this beauty#And drifted out of sight#Where did your heart go#Did you put it on a train#Did you leave it in the rain#Or down in Mexico

The Final Countdown
#
The Final Countdown#We're leaving together,#But still it's farewell#And maybe we'll come back#To earth, who can tell?#I guess there is no one to blame#We're leaving ground (leaving ground)#Will things ever be the same again?#It's the final countdown#The final countdown#Oh#We're heading for Venus (Venus)#And still we stand tall#'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)#And welcome us all, yeah#With so many light years to go#And things to be found (to be found)#I'm sure that we'll all miss her so#It's the final countdown#The final countdown#The final countdown#The final countdown#Oh#The final countdown, oh#It's the final count down#The final countdown#The final countdown#The final countdown#Oh#It's the final count down#We're leaving together#The final count down#We'll all miss her so#It's the final countdown#It's the final countdown#Oh#It's the final countdown, yeah#
